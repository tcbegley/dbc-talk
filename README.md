This repo hosts the code from the Data Science Lab meetup on "Simple data-driven dashboards in Python with Plotly Dash".

## Getting started

The app is pretty simple and has been tested on Python 2 and 3. Install the dependencies with `pip` by running the command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should then be able to run the app with

```
python app.py
```
